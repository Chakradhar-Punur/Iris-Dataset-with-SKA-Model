# Iris-Dataset-with-SKA-Model
The Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA) model is a backpropagation-free learning approach that optimizes neural networks through layer-wise entropy reduction. Applied to the Iris dataset, it updates weights based on knowledge alignment with decision shifts, providing a biologically inspired but slower alternative to traditional training.
